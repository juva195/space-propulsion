This repository contains two significant projects for the Space Propulsion course of my Master's program in Space Engineering.

The primary project involved designing a cryogenic blowdown biliquid engine. This project encompassed the entire design process, from conceptualization to detailed analysis. Key aspects of the project included thermodynamic cycle analysis, engine component selection and design, and performance optimization. This was done through the use of the MATLAB environment and the CEA software to model and simulate the engine.

The secondary project focused on the study and analysis of a propulsion engine using the Rocket Propulsion Analysis (RPA) software. This project provided a study on the use of Inconel-718 in a particular set of environmental costraints.

Both projects demonstrate my skills in propulsion system design, analysis, and simulation, utilizing industry-standard tools and methodologies.
